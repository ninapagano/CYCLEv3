                <h6> Trader Joe’s Organic Açaí Bowl was inspired by the Brazilian specialty called açaí na tigela (“acai in the bowl”). In addition to being sold by beach vendors on the Brazilian coast, some versions of this refreshing, fruity treat have made their way into specialty smoothie shops all around the U.S.</h6>
